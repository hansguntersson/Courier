# Commit and version

## Before every local commit

1. **Bump the version number** in `data.js`:
   - Update `CourierData.VERSION` (e.g. `"1.0.46"` → `"1.0.47"`).
   - This value is shown on the Stats screen (Version row).

2. **Include the version bump** in the same commit as the code changes (so the stat screen always shows the version that matches the code).

## Version mismatch behaviour (already implemented)

- When saved data has a different `version` than current `VERSION`, the game:
  - Wipes the save (`wipeSave()`).
  - Does not load the old state (progress is effectively reset).
  - Shows the main menu / hub screen.

So after a version bump, returning players get a fresh start and land on the hub.
